Spec: # Specification in simple English
Env starts with false
Robot starts with not drop
If you activated drop and you are sensing fire then do not drop
If you activated drop and you are sensing fire then do drop
If you did not activate drop then do drop

#Do pick_up if and only if you are sensing hazardous_item
#Do drop if and only if you were in porch
#If you are activating pick_up or you activated pick_up then stay there
#If you are activating drop or you activated drop then stay there
#If you did not activate pick_up then always not porch
#Visit porch
#Always person and not person














#NON-TRIVIAL EXAMPLES:

#Environment liveness unrealizable
#Env starts with false
#Robot starts with false
#robot starts with false
#If you were in porch then do not hazardous_item
#If drop then not drop
#If drop then drop
#If not drop then drop
#Do pick_up if and only if you are sensing hazardous_item
#Do drop if and only if you were in porch
#If you are activating pick_up or you activated pick_up then go to porch and stay there
#If you are activating drop or you activated drop then stay there
#If you did not activate pick_up then always not porch
#Visit porch
#If you were in porch then infinitely often person and not person
#Go to porch and stay there

##System safety unrealizable
#Env starts with false
#Robot starts in porch
#If you were in porch then do not hazardous_item
#Do pick_up if and only if you are sensing hazardous_item

#Robot starts in deck
#Always not porch
#If you are sensing person then do porch

##Environment safety unrealizable
#Env starts with false
#Robot starts in deck
