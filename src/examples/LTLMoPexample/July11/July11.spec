Spec: # Specification in simple English
### Initial conditions and safety. ###
Robot starts in Safehouse
Env starts with false
Always not Cliff and not Mountain1 and not Mountain2 and not Mountain3
Do not Trail unless you activated carrying_person or you are activating carrying_person

### Rescue mission goals. ###
If you are sensing distress_signal then visit Rescue_Point
carrying_person is set on Rescue_Point and reset on Safehouse
If you are activating carrying_person or you activated carrying_person then visit Safehouse
If you are activating carrying_person or you activated carrying_person then do not Trench
If you are not sensing distress_signal and you are not activating carrying_person then visit Watchtower

### Reconfiguration goals. ###
Do T_narrow if and only if you are in between LeftOfTrench and RightOfTrench
#Do taking_cover if and only if you are sensing air_raid
#Do T_low and T_legged if and only if you are activating taking_cover
